"J. Cole Shows Up at Fan’s College Graduation"_"J. Cole keeps it real when it comes to his fans. The Dreamville rapper surprised one of his most loyal supporters when he showed up to her college graduation, nearly a decade after first meeting her. Back in 2013, Cierra Bosarge-Fussell called into a local radio station with the hopes that Cole would come to her high school and wish her a happy birthday. Three months later, she received a call from Cole, who invited her to meet him in person in Philadelphia, where she presented him with a letter she had written for him years prior. “In the letter it says all I went through,” Bosarge told Complex at the time. “With being adopted, my parents being hooked on drugs, in and out of prison. At the time both parents were in prison so I asked him could he come to my graduation since they can’t.” Cole told Cierra he would attend her high school graduation if she kept her grades up and got into a four-year university. Two years after their meeting, Cole kept his promise and attended Cierra’s high school graduation. And he was there again when Cierra graduated from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey on Wednesday, much to the surprise of her fellow students. Cierra shared photos from the emotional day when she received her college diploma as Cole cheered from the crowd. 'this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch ni**as that hated, old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it,' she wrote in her caption, quoting lyrics from Cole’s 2012 hit 'Nobody’s Perfect.' Cole’s manager Ibrahim Hamad also congratulated her, writing, 'Congrats on your accomplishment, you deserve it!! Love to see it.'"
“5 budgeting tips for college students that can help set you up for financial success”_“Creating a budget in college can help you understand where your money goes each month, which is a good first step to take when you’re learning to manage your finances. With more clarity on your spending and saving habits, you can work toward bigger goals, such as paying off student loan debt, traveling and saving money for future milestones like moving to a new city after college. While you may have fewer expenses during college, it’s still a good time to start tracking your money. The budget you create now can help you throughout your 20s and beyond. Plus once you get the budget set up, you only need to make small adjustments as your income and spending habits change. There are many ways you can go about creating a budget, including using a budgeting app that connects to your bank accounts or making a spreadsheet with an online template. Whichever resource you choose, remember to stick to it and hold yourself accountable so you can achieve your money goals. Here’s how to create a budget as a college student. How to create a budget while in college 1. Calculate your net income 2. List monthly expenses 3. Organize your expenses into fixed and variable categories 4. Determine average monthly costs for each expense 5. Make adjustments 1. Calculate your net income While in college, you may be working a part-time job or internship to help pay for your education and afford everyday expenses. You might also have an income from grants, scholarships, loans or a monthly allowance from your parents. The amount of money you bring in each month is an essential part of your budget and creates the foundation for how much you can afford to spend. As the first step in creating your budget, you’ll want to calculate your net income, which is the amount of money you earn less taxes. If you receive a regular paycheck through your employer, regardless of whether you’re part-time or full-time, the amount deposited into your checking account is your net income. If you’re an hourly employee and your hours vary from week to week, month to month, try to figure out an average amount that you can generally count on each month. It’s better to go with a lower number, so you don’t risk overspending. If you make a freelance income, you’ll want to subtract taxes from your paycheck and save them in a separate account so you’re not surprised by a big tax bill at the end of the year. You can use the TaxAct calculator to estimate how much taxes you’ll be required to pay in a year, then divide by 12 to get a monthly tax estimate. 2. List monthly expenses Next, you’ll want to list all of your monthly expenses. Here are some common college-related expenses: School supplies (such as textbooks and electronics), Rent or room and board, Groceries, Dining, Travel, Gym memberships, Household goods, Phone, internet and monthly streaming subscriptions, Transportation (such as gas, train tickets and bus fares), Loan payments (such as student, auto and personal), Insurance (such as health, rental and auto), Utilities (such as electricity, water and gas), Miscellaneous (such as gifts, entertainment and apparel), And while deposits into a savings account aren’t an expense, it can be helpful to include savings so you remember to put money aside for future goals. 3. Organize your expenses into fixed and variable categories After you listed your monthly expenses, it’s time to categorize which are fixed and which are variable. Fixed expenses are bills you typically can’t avoid and need to pay, including text books, rent/room and board, groceries, transportation, insurance and debt repayment. Variable expenses are more flexible and often include wants, like a gym membership, travel, dining out and entertainment purchases. If your income were to decrease, you could always cancel your gym membership, postpone a vacation or reduce your takeout spending without much fallout. But you’re likely always going to have to pay for rent/room and board, transportation and insurance. 4. Determine average monthly cost for each expense Once you label fixed and variable expenses, list how much you spend on each expense per month. Refer to your bank and credit card statements to get the amount. Many fixed expenses you incur will typically be the same month-to-month, making it easy to put a dollar amount to the cost. For instance, your rent/room and board, meal plan, insurance and phone bills will likely cost the same each month. Some variable expenses may also have a set cost every month, such as your gym membership.However, some fixed and variable expenses don’t have preset costs. If you rent your own apartment off campus and incur utility expenses, such as electric and gas, the cost often fluctuates month-to-month. The same goes for groceries, takeout and household goods. For any categories where your spending varies from month-to-month, you’ll need to do some math to determine the average monthly cost. The calculation is pretty simple: Add up three months worth of spending for an expense and divide by three. You may want to round the total up to increments of five or ten. If your three-month average spending on groceries is $123, you may want to set the spending limit to $125 or $130. 5. Make adjustments The last step in your budgeting process is to compare all the information you gathered and make sure the numbers work out. Look at your net income compared to your monthly expenses and see if you have enough money coming in each month to cover all your costs. If you can’t afford your lifestyle, it’s time to make adjustments. While you can consider ways to make more money, like picking up more hours at work, you should also think about ways you can cut costs. This may include reducing the amount of money you spend on variable expenses, such as limiting takeout orders and cutting streaming subscriptions that you don’t use regularly. You may also want to adjust some fixed expenses with fluctuating costs. When you go grocery shopping, clip digital coupons ahead of time and opt for store-brand items versus name-brand to save extra money. If you’re looking to move, find an apartment with cheaper rent. And if you have money leftover after creating your budget, consider putting it toward any outstanding debt, like a lingering credit card balance, or use it to start saving it for the future. Next steps Now that you’ve put the hard work in and finished creating a budget, it’s important to stick to it. Following your budget while in college can help you pay off debt and graduate with strong financial habits that can help you achieve long-term life goals. To stay on track, hold yourself accountable by setting up reminders to log expenses into your budget every day. If you decide to use a budgeting app, set alerts when you approach your spending limit for different expense categories. You can also set up transaction alerts with your bank or credit union that notify you if you approach a predetermined spending limit. If there’s ever a change in your income or an expense, make sure you adjust your budget accordingly to avoid any mishaps.”
”In a visit to Buffalo, President Biden denounces white supremacy as a poison”_“President Biden traveled to Buffalo, N.Y., to visit the scene of Saturday’s racist massacre at a grocery store, calling on Americans to reject white supremacy and criticizing the racist conspiracy theory that inspired the shooter. ‘White supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison running through our body politic, and it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more,' Biden said in remarks Tuesday at a community center alongside local leaders. 'We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America.’ The president’s trip comes three days after a gunman opened fire in a Tops Friendly Market store in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, leaving 10 people dead. Following his arrest, the 18-year-old alleged suspect told officials he was targeting the Black community. 'What happened here is simple and straightforward: Terrorism. Terrorism. Domestic terrorism,' Biden said, calling the shooting a 'murderous, racist rampage' carried out in the name of a 'hateful and perverse ideology.' President Biden speaks at the Delavan Grider Community Center in Buffalo, N.Y., on Tuesday. Biden listed the names and ages each of the 13 victims — the 10 who were killed, and the three who were injured — along with details about their lives — 'individual lives with love, service and community that speaks to the bigger story of who we are as Americans. A great nation, because we are a good people,' he said. 'In America, evil will not win, I promise you. Hate will not prevail. White supremacy will not have the last word,' Biden said. Biden urges Americans to 'reject the lie' of Replacement theory After the shooting, a document allegedly tied to the gunman emerged online. It includes racist, anti-immigrant views and cites the Replacement theory — a far-right, white nationalist conspiracy theory that baselessly claims that white people in America are being systematically replaced by people of color. 'We’ve now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes,' he said. 'I call on all Americans to reject the lie. I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and for profit.' U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Department of Justice is investigating the shooting 'as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism.' Over the weekend, Biden said any 'racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the fabric of this nation.' 'Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism,' Biden said in a statement Sunday. During their trip on Tuesday, the president and first lady Jill Biden visited the Tops store, which has become a memorial to the 10 who were killed there. They also met with the family members of the victims, first responders, law enforcement and local leaders.In his remarks, Biden also suggested legislative action to combat internet radicalization and gun violence, alluding to his 1994 crime bill which temporarily banned assault weapons.”
“7 signs you’re dating a narcissist, and what to do about it”_“If you’ve been glued to your screens watching the latest season of YOU on Netflix, it’s possible you’ve thought to yourself – there is no way I would fall for this! YOU follows the life of Joe Goldberg, a seemingly caring and respectful young man who actually has a pattern of becoming obsessed with women, stalking them, and eliminating threats to his dominance.In fact, Joe embodies some symptoms of a narcissistic personality disorder – a mental health condition in which people have an inflated opinion of themselves, a need for excessive attention, react negatively to criticism, and a lack of sympathy for others. Sometimes, it’s hard to distinguish between self-absorption or narcissism – whether that’s a narcissistic personality disorder or enough self-obsession to destroy a healthy relationship. So how do you know when you’re dating a narcissist? They lack empathyOne common symptom of a narcissistic personality disorder is a lack of empathy, or an inability to understand how another person is feeling. The way someone with a narcissistic personality experiences emotion is different from most individuals. They often don’t understand how their words, deeds and actions can cause pain or hurt to others. A narcissist is often too self-focused to pick up on and have a deep understanding of other people’s emotions. In a relationship, this would translate to a narcissist saying cruel things in an unconscious manner, but not caring because they don’t feel anyone else’s feelings.They gaslight you Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse that occurs in abusive relationships, where someone leads you to question your sanity and attempt to undermine your perception of reality. It is a form of emotional abuse, and one of the most common traits of a narcissist. The narcissist will say or do something abusive and then deny that it ever happened. They will often use phrases to minimise and invalidate your feelings. Along with making you doubt your memory, narcissists will deflect responsibility, and blame onto you. They don’t have any (or many) long-lasting friendships Most narcissists don’t have many, or any, long-term friendships. They have trouble maintaining relationships and when a friend no longer serves their needs enough, or they threaten their self-image, they will distance themselves or cut them off completely. As a result of not being able to form long-lasting relationships, they will often lash out at your when you want to hang out with your friends. Someone with a narcissistic personality will often make you feel pressured and guilty to spend less time with your friends because they will claim that you don’t spend enough time with them. They’re manipulative Manipulation is a major sign that you could be dating a narcissist. Whether it’s telling you what you’re allowed to wear, or who you’re allowed to spend time with, where you’re allowed to go, if your partner is constantly trying to control you, that’s definitely a red flag. Narcissists are experts at getting what they want, as they have no empathy for other people, they don’t care what impact their manipulation will have on those surrounding them. They use manipulation as a tool to get what they want, which is more often than not, attention, validation and status. They put you down Narcissists hate feeling less than, weak or out of control. For this reason, they will pull you down, call you names, and hit you with hurtful words and jokes. They will often try to sabotage or belittle your job, social life, personality traits or physical appearance. Their end goal is to try and lower your self-esteem so that they can increase their own because it makes them feel more powerful, and gives them a sense of authority. They can’t take criticism Narcissist traits tend to include insecurity, this can manifest in extreme sensitivity to criticism. They will reject or ignore criticism, becoming angry and hostile to others, which makes it difficult for them to work with others and hold a long-lasting relationship. Their need to feel above others makes it difficult for them to take on board suggestions for improvement.Narcissists simply hate not getting their own way, they feel entitled to have their needs and desires met, and they simply can’t deal with the disappointment or rejection. Because of this, they might act out aggressively both vocally and physically to those around them. They never apologise for their behavior Someone with a narcissistic personality will act out abruptly, jealous and self-involved, but despite this behaviour being potentially damaging to their partners mental and physical wellbeing, they will never apologise. Instead, they’ll devalue your feelings by telling you that you are being overly sensitive or too emotional. It’s really difficult to reason with a narcissistic person or make them see your point of view in order to have a healthy discussion, they will instead try educating you on the matter.What to do if you’re dating a narcissist if you believe you’re in a relationship with a narcissist, here the Delamere team have some tips to help you stay sane and deal with the person. Set boundaries: If you want to stay in a relationship with a narcissistic person, you need to acknowledge your self-worth and be able to set personal boundaries to make sure that they’re not controlling your life and stepping all over you. Talk: Talking is a great way to prevent emotions from building up, make friends with people who will let you discuss your problems or join a support group who can help and support you. Choose your battles: Being in a relationship like this will take a lot of patience, you’ll need to accept that you can’t change them and that sometimes it’s easier to let them get their own way instead of retaliating – this way you’ll experience less friction. Protect yourself: The best thing you can do is find ways of dealing with their behaviour, handling their toxic outbreaks, and knowing that you’re not the things you’re accused of. Protect yourself in every way possible and keep your expectations on their behaviour levelled. Step away: Staying with a narcissistic person can be extremely damaging to your self-worth. It’s important to remove yourself from the situation and practise self-care, this is doing things that make you happy, this can anything from going for a run to hanging out with family and friends. It is possible to leave: Leaving a narcissistic relationship will be one of the hardest things you’ll ever do. Narcissists need to abuse and manipulate people to fulfil their needs and to prove they are stronger smarter and better than those surrounding them. You’ll already be exhausted from the constant manipulation, the emotional abuse and the gaslighting, so leaving a toxic relationship with a narcissist is challenging. But it is possible as long as you follow your instinct and have strong boundaries, and constantly remind yourself of why you need to walk away from the situation.”
”An emotional Selena Gomez explains why mental health is ‘personal’ at White House, MTV event”_“As a proud mental health advocate, Selena Gomez is on a mission to shift the cultural narrative from awareness to action by bringing the issue to the White House. Days after her 'Saturday Night Live' appearance, Gomez this week stopped by the nation’s capital to host the first-ever Mental Health Youth Action Forum led by MTV Entertainment — an event encouraging businesses and peers to address the growing youth mental health crisis affecting more than a third of high school students. The forum kicked off one day before Mental Health Action Day created last year by MTVE to inspire taking meaningful action for well-being. Donning a navy sleeveless dress with a floral accent, the 'Only Murders in the Building' star was joined by first lady Jill Biden, Ambassador Susan Rice and 30 activists and creators— all of whom had different personal stories yet shared the same struggle of knowing what it’s like to not be OK. Selena Gomez speaks onstage about her personal mental health struggles and why she and her Rare Impact Fund are deicated to furthering the cause.

Getty Images for MTV entertainment.'The darkness inside of us can feel heavy at times, but we can share the weight of it together,' Biden said Wednesday before introducing Gomez onstage. 'It takes courage to be honest about the struggles that you’ve faced and to tell your stories. And it takes courage to understand that your voice can make a difference, and to show your creativity and talents to all of the world. I’m so proud of everyone here today.' Selena Gomez and Jill Biden attend the first-ever Mental Health Youth Forum hosted by MTV Ent Entertainment. Tasos Katopodis, Getty Images for MTV Entertainment This is not the first time that Gomez has teamed up with the Biden administration to de-stigmatize mental health, having appeared in a virtual conversation with Kamala Harris about the issue in 2020. But on Wednesday, an emotional Gomez displayed the power of leading through example, service and vulnerability by sharing more about her bipolar diagnosis and why the cause is 'very personal' for her. 'I felt like once I found out what was going on mentally, I found that there was more freedom for me to be OK with what I had,' Gomez said. 'Bringing attention to mental health through media or just talking about your own journeys can help. It sets the example that it’s a topic that can and should be discussed freely and without shame.' Along with inspiring openness, she said she hopes the event will evoke tangible changes from key stakeholders to develop accessible, culturally-competent services and resources for young people in need. 'I want to ensure that everyone, no matter their age, their race, religion, sexual orientation, has access to services that support their mental health,' Gomez said. The importance of highlighting ‘young incredible people who are making a real difference.’ Alongside powerful statements from Gomez, Rice and Biden, the discussion panel also included input from young content creators who detailed their struggles with issues ranging from depression to suicidality. In addition, they shared how to funnel these painful experiences to become change-makers, as a tearful Gomez applauded them for their bravery and candor.  Selena Gomez hugs youth mental health leader Ayanna Kelly at the White House in Washington, as first lady Jill Biden speaks during the White House Conversation on Youth Mental Health. Jacquelyn Martin, AP President and CEO of Paramount Media Networks and MTV Entertainment Studios Chris McCarthy, who organized the event, said it was 'crucial' for the event not only to include professionals, but also to prop up young leaders. 'Obviously we can work with experts. We can work with our adult peers. But how do we empower the generation that this (mental health crisis) is impacting the most?'  McCarthy exclusively told USA TODAY in an interview. 'That was the goal of this event… to really elevate and highlight these young incredible people who are making a real difference.' After the forum, Ambassador Rice also spoke to USA TODAY about the urgency of tackling the youth mental health. 'All of us to one degree or another, whether personal lives or those of our families and loved ones and community, we’re all are facing this challenge,' Rice told USA TODAY. 'What I thought was so extraordinary today was one of the young people said, ‘what’s mentionable is manageable.’ And I think that’s exactly the message we have to acknowledge the challenge; We have to recognize that it’s pervading all ages and all aspects of our society. We’re going to be as strong as we possibly can as a nation and care for the people who need it most.' What next? Here’s what else must be done for the growing youth mental health crisis Bringing the mental health crisis to the White House is only the beginning of what McCarthy calls a 'long-term solution' to de-stigmatization. Since 2006, MTV Entertainment has dedicated its programming to eliminate stereotypical and irresponsible representation of mental illness on TV with initiatives like the Mental Health Storytelling Coalition, which was responsible for creating the first-of-its-kind Mental Health Media Guide utilized by NBC Universal, Disney and more. '(We’ve) made commitments around positive portrayals of mental health, really de-stigmatizing and normalizing it… and we have committed to doubling the number of positive portrayals of mental health in our programming,' McCarthy says. Though much progress has been made — as seen by complex portrayals of mental health in shows like HBO Max’s 'Euphoria'and Netflix’s 'BoJack Horseman,' McCarthy says we need to continue transforming awareness into action to better understand, access and treat mental health issues for young Americans. 'I think this is going to take a societal movement. It’s going to take businesses, it’s going to take nonprofits and governments and friends and family to lock arms and really make a sustained difference,' McCarthy says. 'And we’re at the very beginning of that journey. Just the fact that the conversation is being had at this level at so many different places is incredibly important.’”
